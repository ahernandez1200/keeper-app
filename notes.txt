"Once a Response is retrieved, there are a number 
    of methods available to define what the body content
    is and how it should be handled (see Body)." Previously,
    I was trying to parse the response in App.jsx as JSON, that's
    why trying to do anything with it didn't work as expected, since
    the response that I was sending in NoteDetail is not jason.

//plan 4/25

--when trying to get the posts form the db on startup, since we are using usestate, the page keeps rerendering so 
  the fetch call is called continously as a result. 
--So, try to have an array which we will fill on start-up. That is, we make a get request to noteStorage/retrieval 
  and fill the array within that call, Then, in the return near the bottom of app.js, map those notes


//plan 5/3

1. in mongoose connection, modify the schema.
  --now will contain 
    {
      username: String,
      password: String,
      posts: [{
          title: String,
          content: String,
          id: Number
      }]
    }

2. consider using the username as _id since each email is unique...dont do this unless you validate emails
2. create new route for userregistration. we will access this route when making post requests
