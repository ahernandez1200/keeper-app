"Once a Response is retrieved, there are a number 
    of methods available to define what the body content
    is and how it should be handled (see Body)." Previously,
    I was trying to parse the response in App.jsx as JSON, that's
    why trying to do anything with it didn't work as expected, since
    the response that I was sending in NoteDetail is not jason.

//troubleshooting accessing state from redirect.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50328786/unable-to-access-this-props-location-in-component-after-redirect
--basically, you will "cannot read property of state of undefined if you use something
  like:
  <Route exact path="/notes">
            <NotesMain />
  </Route>
--to get it to work, it would have to be in the format:
  <Route exact path="/notes" component={notesMain}/>




//plan 4/25

--when trying to get the posts form the db on startup, since we are using usestate, the page keeps rerendering so 
  the fetch call is called continously as a result. 
--So, try to have an array which we will fill on start-up. That is, we make a get request to noteStorage/retrieval 
  and fill the array within that call, Then, in the return near the bottom of app.js, map those notes


//plan 5/3

1. in mongoose connection, modify the schema.
  --now will contain 
    {
      username: String,
      password: String,
      posts: [{
          title: String,
          content: String,
          id: Number
      }]
    }

2. consider using the username as _id since each email is unique...dont do this unless you validate emails
2. create new route for userregistration. we will access this route when making post requests



plan 5/4

--create login form
--create route for login, make a post request for when the user is trying to validate their login info.
  --check if the username exists, then check the password against what is in the database.
--read about redirect

5/5
-redirect from register after successful login.


plan 5/12
-fix the AddNote method in notesMain to accomodate for the changes made to the way 
  in which user posts are saved in the database

  plan 5/13
  -keep working on AddNote. We need to fix the logic in the post method of noteStorage
  -use findOne.
