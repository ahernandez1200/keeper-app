"Once a Response is retrieved, there are a number 
    of methods available to define what the body content
    is and how it should be handled (see Body)." Previously,
    I was trying to parse the response in App.jsx as JSON, that's
    why trying to do anything with it didn't work as expected, since
    the response that I was sending in NoteDetail is not jason.

next: work on sending note content to noteDetail.

next: work on how to get the info in noteDetail to app.js so that we can then store to database.
