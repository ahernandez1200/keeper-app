# **keeper-app**

## *About*
This web app was built for the purpose of storing notes/memos.

The front-end of this app was developed with React as part of a small project done for the purpose
  of becoming acquainted with the aforementioned framework.
  
However, I've expanded the original project by adding a back-end (Express/Node.js) and also by adding 
  a database (MongoDB), so as to be able to save the notes.
  
 Since this project was developed with only a single user in mind (me), I've further expanded this
  project further by adding registration/login so that others can also make independent use of this
  web app.
